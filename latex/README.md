# LaTeX Project

This is the example of latex project.

## Usage

The intended way to use this package is to use it with `.devcontainer`.
Once, you spawn the `devcontainer` it should install all the dependencies and you can start using it.

Make sure that you have [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension installed in your VSCode.

When you open the `.tex` file, it should automatically detect the LaTeX project and the left side panel should show the LaTeX Workshop options.

Open the `LaTeX Workshop` panel by clicking the menu on the left panel or use MAC:<kbd>⌥+⌘+X</kbd>.
You should see the list of commands available for `LaTeX Workshop`.

To build the project, you can use the command `LaTeX Workshop: Build LaTeX project` or use the shortcut <kbd>⌘+Shift+B</kbd>.
